 ERROR 1 (7->node2): 4 devices detected but HPL MxP needs exactly 1 device per process at (src/driver.cpp:397)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
MPI_ABORT was invoked on rank 7 in communicator MPI_COMM_WORLD
with errorcode 1.

NOTE: invoking MPI_ABORT causes Open MPI to kill all MPI processes.
You may or may not see output from other processes, depending on
exactly when Open MPI kills them.
