[node1:1602104] [[14664,0],0] ORTE_ERROR_LOG: Bad parameter in file ess_hnp_module.c at line 549
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
It looks like orte_init failed for some reason; your parallel process is
likely to abort.  There are many reasons that a parallel process can
fail during orte_init; some of which are due to configuration or
environment problems.  This failure appears to be an internal failure;
here's some additional information (which may only be relevant to an
Open MPI developer):

  orte_rmaps_base_open failed
  --> Returned value Bad parameter (-5) instead of ORTE_SUCCESS
