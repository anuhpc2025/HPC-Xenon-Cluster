--------------------------------------------------------------------------
An invalid value was given for the number of processes
per resource (ppr) to be mapped on each node:

  PPR:  1:l3cache,pe=4

The specification must be a comma-separated list containing
combinations of number, followed by a colon, followed
by the resource type. For example, a value of "1:socket" indicates that
one process is to be mapped onto each socket. Values are supported
for hwthread, core, L1-3 caches, socket, numa, and node. Note that
enough characters must be provided to clearly specify the desired
resource (e.g., "nu" for "numa").
