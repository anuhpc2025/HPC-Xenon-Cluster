--------------------------------------------------------------------------
An unrecognized value was given for the number of processes
per resource (ppr) to be mapped on each node:

  Value:  gpu
  PPR:  1:gpu

The specification must be a number, followed by a colon, followed
by the resource type. For example, a value of "1:slot" indicates that
anything over one process per slot is to be considered oversubscribed.
Only values for "hwthread", "core", "socket",
"l1cache", "l2cache", "l3cache", "numa", and "node" are allowed. Note that
enough characters must be provided to clearly specify the desired
resource (e.g., "nu" for "numa").
