================================================================================

An explanation of the input/output parameters follows:
T/V    : Wall time / encoded variant.
N      : The order of the coefficient matrix A.
NB     : The partitioning blocking factor.
P      : The number of process rows.
Q      : The number of process columns.
Time   : Time in seconds to solve the linear system.
Gflops : Rate of execution for solving the linear system.

The following parameter values will be used:

N      :  271872 
NB     :     512 
PMAP   : Column-major process mapping
P      :       4 
Q      :       4 
PFACT  :    Left 
NBMIN  :       2 
NDIV   :       2 
RFACT  :    Left 
BCAST  :  2ringM 
DEPTH  :       1 
SWAP   : Spread-roll (long)
L1     : no-transposed form
U      : transposed form
EQUIL  : no
ALIGN  : 8 double precision words

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- The matrix A is randomly generated for each test.
- The following scaled residual check will be computed:
      ||Ax-b||_oo / ( eps * ( || x ||_oo * || A ||_oo + || b ||_oo ) * N )
- The relative machine precision (eps) is taken to be               1.110223e-16
- Computational tests pass if scaled residuals are less than                16.0


HPL-NVIDIA ignores the following parameters from input file:
	* Broadcast parameters
	* Panel factorization parameters
	* Look-ahead value
	* L1 layout
	* U layout
	* Equilibration parameter
	* Memory alignment parameter

HPL-NVIDIA settings from environment variables:
--- DEVICE INFO ---
  Peak clock frequency: 1410 MHz
  SM version          : 80
  Number of SMs       : 108
