sst: unrecognized option '--add-element-lib=merlin'
Usage: sst [options] config-file
  Arguments to options contained in [] are optional
  Notes on flag options (options that take an optional BOOL value):
   - BOOL values can be expressed as true/false, yes/no, on/off or 1/0
   - Program default for flags is false
   - BOOL values default to true if flag is specified but no value is supplied

Options annotated with 'H' have extended help available
Options annotated with 'S' can be set in the SDL file (input configuration file)
  - Note: Options set on the command line take precedence over options set in the SDL file


Informational Options
-h --usage                            Print usage information.
   --help=option                      Print extended help information for
                                      requested option.

                                      will simply increment the verbosity level.

                                      this is most often done by just
                                      specifying the file without an option.
   --model-options=STR                Provide options to the python

                                      will be appended to the model options (or
                                      used as the model options if

                                      output type (--output-config and/or
                                      --output-json).  Note: this will also
                                      cause partition info to be output if set
                                      to true.

                                      --output-json or --output-config options,
                                      will cause paritition information to be
                                      added to graph output.

                                      SINGLE and MULTI (default).  If NONE is
                                      specified, parallel-load is turned off.
                                      If SINGLE is specified, the same file
                                      will be passed to all MPI ranks.  If
                                      MULTI is specified, each MPI rank is
                                      required to have it's own file to load.
                                      Note, not all input formats support both
                                      types of file loading.

                                      numbers for that value, lower case
                                      letters represent the units and are
                                      required for those formats.).
   --checkpoint-period=PERIOD       S Set approximate frequency for checkpoints
                                      to be generated in terms of simulated
                                      time. PERIOD must include time units (s
                                      or Hz) and SI prefixes are accepted. This
                                      flag will eventually be removed in favor
                                      of --checkpoint-sim-period
   --checkpoint-sim-period=PERIOD   S Set approximate frequency for checkpoints
                                      to be generated in terms of simulated
                                      time. PERIOD must include time units (s
                                      or Hz) and SI prefixes are accepted.
   --load-checkpoint                  Load checkpoint and continue simulation.
                                      Specified SDL file will be used as the
                                      checkpoint file.
   --checkpoint-prefix=PREFIX      HS Set prefix for checkpoint filenames. The
                                      checkpoint prefix defaults to checkpoint
                                      if this option is not set and
                                      checkpointing is enabled.
   --checkpoint-name-format=FORMAT HS Set the format for checkpoint filenames.
                                      See extended help for format options. 
                                      Default is "%p_%n_%t/%p_%n_%t"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
mpirun has exited due to process rank 1 with PID 1814858 on
node node2 exiting improperly. There are three reasons this could occur:

1. this process did not call "init" before exiting, but others in
the job did. This can cause a job to hang indefinitely while it waits
for all processes to call "init". By rule, if one process calls "init",
then ALL processes must call "init" prior to termination.

2. this process called "init", but exited without calling "finalize".
By rule, all processes that call "init" MUST call "finalize" prior to
exiting or it will be considered an "abnormal termination"

3. this process called "MPI_Abort" or "orte_abort" and the mca parameter
orte_create_session_dirs is set to false. In this case, the run-time cannot
detect that the abort call was an abnormal termination. Hence, the only
error message you will receive is this one.

This may have caused other processes in the application to be
terminated by signals sent by mpirun (as reported here).

You can avoid this message by specifying -quiet on the mpirun command line.
